The Talend v5 platform is a holistic integration solution that enables IT organizations
to converge traditionally disparate integration efforts and practices through a common
set of products, tools and best practices.

Built on the same open core model, all Talend products contribute to the open source 
community and leverage popular open source projects. Designed and developed using the
same methodology and philosophy, Talend’s enterprise-ready open source solutions address
all the integration needs of organizations, regardless of their size or industry.

The Talend Unified Platform provides a common foundation for the products to be used
individually or in concert depending on the needs of the organization.
